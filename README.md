# My Personal Portfolio and Website

Welcome! Over the summer of 2021, I have dedicated my free time to expose myself in the creative pool of web development. I have spent 40+ hours watching turorials and reading blog posts to learn the fundamental process of web design and languages such as **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**. Ultimately, I have created a media responsive and interactive portfolio!

Everything worth knowing about me can be found here including my academic and everyday passions.ours teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website from scratch. I hope to create a website that authentically represents me. I can't wait for you to learn more about me. Please don't be afraid to reach out to me!
